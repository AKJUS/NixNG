Welcome to the documentation of the NixNG project!

This documentation is intended for NixNG developers, NixNG module documentation,
which will be autogenerated like the one on [[https://search.nixos.org/]] is
planned.

First things first, you can get an overview of the repository structure
[[file:structure.org][here]]. Then please make sure to familiarize yourself with [[file:reuse.org][REUSE]]. To learn how to
contribute to this documentation visit [[file:writing_documentation.org][Writing Documentation]]. There are also
some [[file:style_and_vocabulary.org][generic hints]] on the style of the whole project.
