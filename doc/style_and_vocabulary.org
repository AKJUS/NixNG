* Style and Vocabulary
** Style
*** 80 Columns
Stick to 80 columns in these documents. Org mode has
visual line wrapping (~visual-line-mode~ in Emacs), but we cannot assume
everyone has access to Emacs.
*** Nix Library Imports
It's preferred to just ~with lib;~ and ~with nglib;~ when either is needed, the
function names are well known and not ambigous so they can't be mistaken with
packages or other such things.

** Vocabulary
These are basic term definitions, mostly common variable names which help in
writing understandable and uniform code.

- *nixpkgs* - a "raw" nixpkgs attribute set, as from a flake input, requires
  importing with ~system~, generally refers to the stable branch of nixpkgs
- *nixpkgs-unstable/master* - a more specific version of nixpkgs
- *pkgs* - already imported nixpkgs, specific to a system
- *lib* - the Nix library from nixpkgs
- *nglib* - NixNG's own Nix library
- *NixOS module* - TBD
- *NixNG module* - a module specific to NixNG
- *home-manager module* - a module specific to home-manager
